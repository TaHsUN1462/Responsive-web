            <p>
                Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable
                of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could
                do, such as reasoning, making decisions, or solving problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that
                power many of the services and goods we use every day – from
                apps that recommend tv shows to chatbots that provide customer
                support in real time. But do all of these really constitute
                artificial intelligence as most of us envision it? And if not,
                then why do we use the term so often?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article, you’ll learn more about artificial
                intelligence, what it actually does, and different types of it.
                In the end, you’ll also learn about some of its benefits and
                dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you expand
                your knowledge of AI even further.
            </p>
            <h2>What is artificial intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> is the theory and
                development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that
                historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing
                speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an
                umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of technologies,
                including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
                processing (NLP).
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the term is commonly used to describe a range of
                different technologies in use today, many disagree on whether
                these actually constitute artificial intelligence. Instead, some
                argue that much of the technology used in the real world today
                actually constitutes highly advanced machine learning that is
                simply a first step towards true artificial intelligence, or
                “general artificial intelligence” (GAI).
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, despite the many philosophical disagreements over whether
                “true” intelligent machines actually exist, when most people use
                the term AI today, they’re referring to a suite of machine
                learning-powered technologies, such as Chat GPT or computer
                vision, that enable machines to perform tasks that previously
                only humans can do like generating written content, steering a
                car, or analyzing data.
            </p>
            <h2>Artificial intelligence examples</h2>
            <p>
                Though the humanoid robots often associated with AI (think Star
                Trek: The Next Generation’s Data or Terminator’s T-800) don’t
                exist yet, you’ve likely interacted with machine
                learning-powered services or devices many times before.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the simplest level, machine learning uses algorithms trained
                on data sets to create machine learning models that allow
                computer systems to perform tasks like making song
                recommendations, identifying the fastest way to travel to a
                destination, or translating text from one language to another.
                Some of the most common examples of AI in use today include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ChatGPT: </strong> Uses large language models (LLMs)
                    to generate text in response to questions or comments posed
                    to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Google Translate: </strong> Uses deep learning
                    algorithms to translate text from one language to another.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Netflix: </strong>
                    Uses machine learning algorithms to create personalized
                    recommendation engines for users based on their previous
                    viewing history.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Tesla: </strong>
                    Uses computer vision to power self-driving features on their
                    cars.
                </li>
